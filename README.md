# PINNs implementation in Python-Notebooks
This is a repository for my Physics-Informed Neural Networks, designed for solvment of differential equations.

* In folder DeepXDE there are differential equation solved with the DeepXDE library

* In folder Method Testing there are my own methods of mine which i test to solve differencial equations

* In folder Methods Completed there are completed PINNs which solve problems, with methods created by using tensorflow
